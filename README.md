## Make Change Project

### Description
This is a cash register program designed to,
give the exact and least amounts of dollars and coins,
and will let the user know if they have under paid, and
what the remaining balance is. The program is fragile, using anything other than numerals and one smartly used decimal will crash the program.
### Lessons Learned
This was a hard one, overall I'm still learning.
I relearned; using booleans while trying to debug and force some operations to happen, breaks while trying to stop infinite repeating code, and continues trying to push code along.
I thought I understood using loops but it's a concept I will continue to revisit, the program was supposed to loop it's prompt it left me scratching my head, as I needed to focus on barebones completion. Ideally I wanted to have the user be able to continue using the program or exit at will, but I'm not quite there yet in terms of executing my ideas.

Im still scratching my head on the infinite repeating code; but I did have the idea to use a boolean statement to try and break that up, but ultimately I ended up using a method to do it, its possible that I may have cleared the bug by pure happenstance.
